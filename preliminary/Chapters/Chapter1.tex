Social media has become an integral part of our lives in the past years as we spend more time online than ever before. Roughly 30\% of our online time is spent on social media interactions, Twitter being one of them \cite{globalwebindex}.
Twitter is arguably the largest source of news on the internet. This is due to the nature of information spreading on the platform through tweets and retweets. At this point, because of the scale, it is impossible to monitor it all to make sure everything is accurate and that there is no false propaganda being spread. 

\section{Aim}
The aim of this project is to create a program with an underlying algorithm that will attempt to figure out whether a Twitter account is under the control of a human or is purely being controlled by a script that someone wrote. The issue doesn't come from there being accounts not directly used by people or 'bots', instead from the ones that claim to be real individuals when they in fact are not. With the use of a program such as this, it is possible to see trends in current events and point out patterns in how the network of these bots are run and what they are targeting exactly.
